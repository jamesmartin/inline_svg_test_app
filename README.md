A Rails application for testing the
[inline_svg](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg) gem locally.

* SVGs live in ./app/assets/images/ for most branches
* SVGs live in ./app/webpacker/images/ for any `-webpacker` branches

There are long-lived branches for different major Rails versions (to check
compatibility):

* [Rails 7.0.0.rc1](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/tree/rails7)
* [Rails 6.0.0.rc1 (Webpacker)](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/tree/rails6-webpacker)
* [Rails 6.0.0.rc1 (Sprockets)](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/tree/rails6)
* [Rails 5.2.6](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/tree/rails5)
